Writer's Tools is a set of utilities designed to help OpenOffice.org users perform a wide range of tasks. Using Writer's Tools, you can back up documents, look up and translate words and phrases, manage text snippets, and keep tabs on document statistics.

Writer's Tools includes the following utilities:

  * **Lookup Tool** lets you look up the currently selected word in several online references, including Cambridge Dictionaries, WordNet, and Google Define.
  * **Google Translate** can help you to quickly translate selected text fragments between different languages using the Google Translate service.

Long live OpenOffice and especially Writer's Tools. If you were next to me right now I would give ya' the biggest, most cuddliest bear hug you could ever imagine. Love you so long time Writer's Tools inventors. Love you soooo long time."_ Post in the Writer's Tools group by Michael J.
