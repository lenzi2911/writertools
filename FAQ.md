### Is there a manual of sorts? ###

Yes, a comprehensive Writer's Tools manual is available in both printed and PDF formats at the [Lulu bookstore](http://www.lulu.com/content/2115121). The manual covers all the important topics, which can help you to get the most out of the Writer's Tools OpenOffice.org extension. It's easier to read, too.

### I entered incorrect browser path. How do I fix that? ###

**On Windows XP with OpenOffice.org 3.0** Navigate to _C:\Documents and Settings\USER\Application Data\OpenOffice.org\3\user_ (replace _USER_ with your actual user name) and delete the _writertools_ folder. On **Windows Vista** and **Windows 7**, the path is _C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\OpenOffice.org\3\user_. Next time you use Writer's Tools, you'll be prompted to enter the path to a browser.

**On Linux with OpenOffice.org 3.0** Navigate to the hidden _OpenOffice.org_ folder in your home directory and delete the _writertools_ folder. Next time you use Writer's Tools, you'll be prompted to enter the path to a browser.

### I installed the downloaded archive, but the extension doesn't work. Am I doing something wrong? ###

Yes. You have to unpack the downloaded archive first, and then install the WriterTools.oxt extension using the Extension Manager.

### I'm using Writer's Tools on Windows Vista. Is there anything I should know? ###

It seems that OpenOffice.org Basic doesn't support Windows Vista native dialogs. Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix. In OpenOffice.org, choose Tools -> Options and navigate to OpenOffice.org -> General. Tick the _Use OpenOffice.org dialogs_ check box. That should do the trick.


### Does Writer's Tools work with Mac OS X? ###

It should, but I haven't tested it. If you encounter a bug or a problem on Mac OS X, make sure to report them in the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/writertools/issues/list) sections.

### Where do I get help with Writer's Tools? ###

If you have questions, problems, or ideas how to improve Writer's Tools, post them in the [Writer's Tools Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/writertools). If you think you've found a bug, report it in the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/writertools/issues/list) section.

### Is it possible to install only the tools I need ###

Not really. But you can use the [Bookmarks Menu](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/bookmarksmenu) extension to bookmark often-used tools.
